from fairest creatures we desire increase
that thereby beautys rose might never die
but as the riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
feedst thy lights flame with self substantial fuel
making a famine where abundance lies
thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament
and only herald to the gaudy spring
within thine own bud buriest thy content
and tender churl makst waste in niggarding
pity the world or else this glutton be
to eat the worlds due by the grave and thee

when forty winters shall besiege thy brow
and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
thy youths proud livery so gazed on now
will be a tattered weed of small worth held
then being asked where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days
to say within thine own deep sunken eyes
were an all eating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beautys use
if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine
shall sum my count and make my old excuse
proving his beauty by succession thine
this were to be new made when thou art old
and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold

look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
for where is she so fair whose uneard womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his self love to stop posterity
thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime
so thou through windows of thine age shalt see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
but if thou live remembered not to be
die single and thine image dies with thee

unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thy self thy beautys legacy
natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
for having traffic with thy self alone
thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
which used lives the executor to be

those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
for never resting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there
sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
beauty oer snowed and bareness every where
then were not summers distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beautys effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
but flowers distilled though they with winter meet
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet

then let not winters ragged hand deface
in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
with beautys treasure ere it be self killed
that use is not forbidden usury
which happies those that pay the willing loan
thats for thy self to breed another thee
or ten times happier be it ten for one
ten times thy self were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living in posterity
be not self willed for thou art much too fair
to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir

lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head each under eye
doth homage to his new appearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty
and having climbed the steep up heavenly hill
resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes fore duteous now converted are
from his low tract and look another way
so thou thyself outgoing in thy noon
unlooked on diest unless thou get a son

music to hear why hearst thou music sadly
sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly
or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of well tuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering
resembling sire and child and happy mother
who all in one one pleasing note do sing
whose speechless song being many seeming one
sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none

is it for fear to wet a widows eye
that thou consumst thy self in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
but beautys waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
no love toward others in that bosom sits
that on himself such murdrous shame commits

for shame deny that thou bearst love to any
who for thy self art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
but that thou none lovst is most evident
for thou art so possessed with murderous hate
that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
o change thy thought that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
or to thyself at least kind hearted prove
make thee another self for love of me
that beauty still may live in thine or thee

as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst
in one of thine from that which thou departest
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
without this folly age and cold decay
if all were minded so the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endowed she gave thee more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
thou shouldst print more not let that copy die

when i do count the clock that tells the time
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
when i behold the violet past prime
and sable curls all silvered oer with white
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summers green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
and die as fast as they see others grow
and nothing gainst times scythe can make defense
save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence

o that you were your self but love you are
no longer yours than you your self here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination then you were
yourself again after yourselves decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honor might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winters day
and barren rage of deaths eternal cold
o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
you had a father let your son say so

not from the stars do i my judgement pluck
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good or evil luck
of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
or else of thee this i prognosticate
thy end is truths and beautys doom and date

when i consider every thing that grows
holds in perfection but a little moment
that this huge stage presenteth naught but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment
when i perceive that men as plants increase
cheered and checked even by the self same sky
vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
and wear their brave state out of memory
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
sets you most rich in youth before my sight
where wasteful time debateth with decay
to change your day of youth to sullied night
and all in war with time for love of you
as he takes from you i engraft you new

but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify your self in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
now stand you on the top of happy hours
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
much liker than your painted counterfeit
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this times pencil or my pupil pen
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live your self in eyes of men
to give away yourself keeps yourself still
and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill

who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were filled with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
which hides your life and shows not half your parts
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces
so should my papers yellowed with their age
be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be termed a poets rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
but were some child of yours alive that time
you should live twice in it and in my rhyme

shall i compare thee to a summers day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summers lease hath all too short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimmed
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or natures changing course untrimmed
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owst
nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou growst
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this and this gives life to thee

devouring time blunt thou the lions paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws
and burn the long lived phoenix in her blood
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
and do whatever thou wilt swift footed time
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beautys pattern to succeeding men
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
my love shall in my verse ever live young

a womans face with natures own hand painted
hast thou the master mistress of my passion
a womans gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false womens fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth
and for a woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting
and by addition me of thee defeated
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
but since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure
mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure

so is it not with me as with that muse
stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
who heaven itself for ornament doth use
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
making a couplement of proud compare
with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems
with aprils first born flowers and all things rare
that heavens air in this huge rondure hems
o let me true in love but truly write
and then believe me my love is as fair
as any mothers child though not so bright
as those gold candles fixed in heavens air
let them say more that like of hearsay well
i will not praise that purpose not to sell

my glass shall not persuade me i am old
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee times furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
as i not for myself but for thee will
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
thou gavst me thine not to give back again

as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put beside his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart
so i for fear of trust forget to say
the perfect ceremony of loves rite
and in mine own loves strength seem to decay
oerchargd with burthen of mine own loves might
o let my looks be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more expressed
o learn to read what silent love hath writ
to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit

mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
thy beautys form in table of my heart
my body is the frame wherein tis held
and perspective it is best painters art
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosoms shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
are windows to my breast where through the sun
delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
they draw but what they see know not the heart

let those who are in favor with their stars
of public honor and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlooked for joy in that i honor most
great princes favorites their fair leaves spread
but as the marigold at the suns eye
and in themselves their pride lies buried
for at a frown they in their glory die
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foiled
is from the book of honor razed quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toiled
then happy i that love and am beloved
where i may not remove nor be removed

lord of my love to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty not to show my wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare in wanting words to show it
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it
till whatsoever star that guides my moving
points on me graciously with fair aspect
and puts apparel on my tattered loving
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect
then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me

weary with toil i haste me to my bed
the dear respose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind when bodys works expired
for then my thoughts from far where i abide 
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my souls imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous and her old face new
lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
for thee and for myself no quiet find

how can i then return in happy plight
that am debarred the benefit of rest
when days oppression is not eased by night
but day by night and night by day oppressed
and each though enemies to eithers reign
do in consent shake hands to torture me
the one by toil the other to complain
how far i toil still farther off from thee
i tell the day to please him thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
so flatter i the swart complexioned night
when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger

when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon myself and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featured like him like him with friends possessed
desiring this mans art and that mans scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
haply i think on thee  and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
that then i scorn to change my state with kings

when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear times waste
then can i drown an eye unused to flow
for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
and weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe
and moan the expense of many a vanished sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell oer
the sad account of fore bemoaned moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
but if the while i think on thee dear friend
all losses are restored and sorrows end

thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all loves loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stolen from mine eye
as interest of the dead which now appear
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many now is thine alone
their images i loved i view in thee
and thou all they hast all the all of me

if thou survive my well contented day
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more re survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
compare them with the bettring of the time
and though they be outstripped by every pen
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
had my friends muse grown with this growing age
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage
but since he died and poets better prove
theirs for their style ill read his for his love

full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendor on my brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath masked him from me now
yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth

why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to let base clouds oertake me in my way
hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my storm beaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent yet i have still the loss
the offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
to him that bears the strong offences cross
ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds

no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this
authorizing thy trespass with compare
myself corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense 
thy adverse party is thy advocate 
and gainst myself a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
that i an accessary needs must be
to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me

let me confess that we two must be twain
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots that do with me remain
without thy help by me be borne alone
in our two loves there is but one respect
though in our lives a separable spite
which though it alter not loves sole effect
yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight
i may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
nor thou with public kindness honor me
unless thou take that honor from thy name
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report

as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
or any of these all or all or more
entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
so then i am not lame poor nor despised
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
that i in thy abundance am sufficed
and by a part of all thy glory live
look what is best that best i wish in thee
this wish i have then ten times happy me

how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thy self the thanks if aught in me
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thy self dost give invention light
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
eternal numbers to outlive long date
if my slight muse do please these curious days
the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise

o how thy worth with manners may i sing
when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what ist but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live
and our dear love lose name of single one
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deservst alone
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
and that thou teachest how to make one twain
by praising him here who doth hence remain

take all my loves my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest
by willful taste of what thyself refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear loves wrong than hates known injury
lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
kill me with spites yet we must not be foes

those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won
beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos what womans son
will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth 
hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
thine by thy beauty being false to me

that thou hast her it is not all my grief
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suffering my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain
and losing her my friend hath found that loss
both find each other and i lose both twain
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
but heres the joy my friend and i are one
sweet flattery then she loves but me alone

when most i wink then do mine eyes best see
for all the day they view things unrespected
but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee
and darkly bright are bright in dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadows form form happy show
to the clear day with thy much clearer light
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would i say mine eyes be blessed made
by looking on thee in the living day
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
all days are nights to see till i see thee
and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me

if the dull substance of my flesh were thought
injurious distance should not stop my way
for then despite of space i would be brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land
as soon as think the place where he would be
but ah thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
but that so much of earth and water wrought
i must attend times leisure with my moan
receiving naught by elements so slow
but heavy tears badges of eithers woe

the other two slight air and purging fire
are both with thee wherever i abide
the first my thought the other my desire
these present absent with swift motion slide
for when these quicker elements are gone
in tender embassy of love to thee
my life being made of four with two alone
sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
until lifes composition be recurred
by those swift messengers returned from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health recounting it to me
this told i joy but then no longer glad
i send them back again and straight grow sad

mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie 
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes 
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to side this title is impaneled
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part
as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part
and my hearts right thy inward love of heart

betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famished for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
with my loves picture then my eye doth feast
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
another time mine eye is my hearts guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love
thy self away art present still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them and they with thee
or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight

how careful was i when i took my way
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief
thee have i not locked up in any chest
save where thou art not though i feel thou art
within the gentle closure of my breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
and even thence thou wilt be stolen i fear
for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear

against that time if ever that time come
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
called to that audit by advised respects
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert
and this my hand against my self uprear
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part
to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
since why to love i can allege no cause

how heavy do i journey on the way
when what i seek my weary travels end
doth teach that ease and that repose to say
thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
the beast that bears me tired with my woe
plods dully on to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers with a groan
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
for that same groan doth put this in my mind
my grief lies onward and my joy behind

thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer when from thee i speed
from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
therefore desire of perfectst love being made
shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
but love for love thus shall excuse my jade 
since from thee going he went willful slow
towards thee ill run and give him leave to go

so am i as the rich whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
since seldom coming in that long year set
like stones of worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
to make some special instant special blest
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
being had to triumph being lacked to hope

what is your substance whereof are you made
that millions of strange shadows on you tend
since every one hath every one one shade
and you but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis and the counterfeit
is poorly imitated after you
on helens cheek all art of beauty set
and you in grecian tires are painted new
speak of the spring and foison of the year
the one doth shadow of your beauty show
the other as your bounty doth appear
and you in every blessed shape we know
in all external grace you have some part
but you like none none you for constant heart

o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odor which doth in it live
the canker blooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
when summers breath their masked buds discloses
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwood and unrespected fade
die to themselves sweet roses do not so
of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
when that shall vade by verse distills your truth

not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
and broils root out the work of masonry
nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
gainst death and all oblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
so till the judgment that yourself arise
you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes

sweet love renew thy force be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite
which but to day by feeding is allayed
to morrow sharpened in his former might
so love be thou although to day thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness
to morrow see again and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dullness
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore where two contracted new
come daily to the banks that when they see
return of love more blest may be the view
or call it winter which being full of care
makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare

being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
nor dare i chide the world without end hour
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of naught
save where you are how happy you make those
so true a fool is love that in your will
though you do anything he thinks no ill

that god forbid that made me first your slave
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
or at your hand the account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck
the imprisoned absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each check
without accusing you of injury
be where you list your charter is so strong
that you yourself may privilege your time
to what you will to you it doth belong
yourself to pardon of self doing crime
i am to wait though waiting so be hell
not blame your pleasure be it ill or well

if there be nothing new but that which is
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which laboring for invention bear amiss
the second burthen of a former child
o that record could with a backward look
even of five hundred courses of the sun
show me your image in some antique book
since mind at first in character was done
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended or where better they
or whether revolution be the same
o sure i am the wits of former days
to subjects worse have given admiring praise

like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beautys brow
feeds on the rarities of natures truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand

is it thy will thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee
so far from home into my deeds to pry
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenure of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
from me far off with others all too near

sin of self love possesseth all mine eye
and all my soul and all my every part
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true no truth of such account
and for myself mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me myself indeed
beated and chopped with tanned antiquity
mine own self love quite contrary i read
self so self loving were iniquity
tis thee myself that for myself i praise
painting my age with beauty of thy days

against my love shall be as i am now
with times injurious hand crushed and oerworn
when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travelled on to ages steepy night
and all those beauties whereof now hes king
are vanishing or vanished out of sight
stealing away the treasure of his spring
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding ages cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
and they shall live and he in them still green

when i have seen by times fell hand defaced
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see down razed
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss and loss with store
when i have seen such interchange of state
or state itself confounded to decay
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate 
that time will come and take my love away
this thought is as a death which cannot choose
but weep to have that which it fears to lose

since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality oersways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summers honey breath hold out
against the wrackful siege of battering days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
o none unless this miracle have might
that in black ink my love may still shine bright

tired with all these for restful death i cry
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimmed in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and gilded honor shamefully misplaced
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and strength by limping sway disabled
and art made tongue tied by authority
and folly doctor like controlling skill
and simple truth miscalled simplicity
and captive good attending captain ill
tired with all these from these would i be gone
save that to die i leave my love alone

ah wherefore with infection should he live
and with his presence grace impiety
that sin by him advantage should achieve
and lace itself with his society
why should false painting imitate his cheek
and steel dead seeming of his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow since his rose is true
why should he live now nature bankrupt is
beggard of blood to blush through lively veins
for she hath no exchequer now but his
and proud of many lives upon his gains
o him she stores to show what wealth she had
in days long since before these last so bad

thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now
before these bastard signs of fair were born
or durst inhabit on a living brow
before the golden tresses of the dead
the right of sepulchers were shorn away
to live a second life on second head
ere beautys dead fleece made another gay
in him those holy antique hours are seen
without all ornament itself and true
making no summer of anothers green
robbing no old to dress his beauty new
and him as for a map doth nature store
to show false art what beauty was of yore

those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
they look into the beauty of thy mind
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
but why thy odor matcheth not thy show
the soil is this that thou dost common grow

that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
for slanders mark was ever yet the fair
the ornament of beauty is suspect
a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
so thou be good slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater being wood of time
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
and thou presentst a pure unstained prime
thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
either not assailed or victor being charged
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
to tie up envy evermore enlarged
if some suspect of ill masked not thy show
then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe

no longer mourn for me when i am dead
than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
nay if you read this line remember not
the hand that writ it for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
o if i say you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse
but let your love even with my life decay
lest the wise world should look into your moan
and mock you with me after i am gone

o lest the world should task you to recite
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death dear love forget me quite
for you in me can nothing worthy prove
unless you would devise some virtuous lie
to do more for me than mine own desert
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest your true love may seem false in this
that you for love speak well of me untrue
my name be buried where my body is
and live no more to shame nor me nor you
for i am shamed by that which i bring forth
and so should you to love things nothing worth

that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west
which by and by black night doth take away
deaths second self that seals up all in rest
in me thou seest the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the death bed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourished by
this thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong
to love that well which thou must leave ere long

but be contented when that fell arrest
without all bail shall carry me away
my life hath in this line some interest
which for memorial still with thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee
the earth can have but earth which is his due
my spirit is thine the better part of me
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
the prey of worms my body being dead
the coward conquest of a wretchs knife
too base of thee to be remembered
the worth of that is that which it contains
and that is this and this with thee remains

so are you to my thoughts as food to life
or as sweet seasoned showers are to the ground
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as twixt a miser and his wealth is found
now proud as an enjoyer and anon
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
now counting best to be with you alone
then bettered that the world may see my pleasure
sometime all full with feasting on your sight
and by and by clean starved for a look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what is had or must from you be took
thus do i pine and surfeit day by day
or gluttoning on all or all away

why is my verse so barren of new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside
to new found methods and to compounds strange
why write i still all one ever the same
and keep invention in a noted weed
that every word doth almost tell my name
showing their birth and where they did proceed
o know sweet love i always write of you
and you and love are still my argument
so all my best is dressing old words new
spending again what is already spent
for as the sun is daily new and old
so is my love still telling what is told

thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
these vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear
and of this book this learning mayst thou taste
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
times thievish progress to eternity
look what thy memory cannot contain
commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
those children nursed delivered from thy brain
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
these offices so oft as thou wilt look
shall profit thee and much enrich thy book

so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
have added feathers to the learneds wing
and given grace a double majesty
yet be most proud of that which i compile
whose influence is thine and born of thee
in others works thou dost but mend the style
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
but thou art all my art and dost advance
as high as learning my rude ignorance

whilst i alone did call upon thy aid
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
but now my gracious numbers are decayed
and my sick muse doth give an other place
i grant sweet love thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of and pays it thee again
he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
from thy behavior beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek he can afford
no praise to thee but what in thee doth live
then thank him not for that which he doth say
since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay

o how i faint when i of you do write
knowing a better spirit doth use your name
and in the praise thereof spends all his might
to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame
but since your worth wide as the ocean is 
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear
my saucy bark inferior far to his
on your broad main doth willfully appear
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
or being wracked i am a worthless boat
he of tall building and of goodly pride
then if he thrive and i be cast away
the worst was this my love was my decay

or i shall live your epitaph to make
or you survive when i in earth am rotten
from hence your memory death cannot take
although in me each part will be forgotten
your name from hence immortal life shall have
though i once gone to all the world must die
the earth can yield me but a common grave
when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
your monument shall be my gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall oer read
and tongues to be your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead
you still shall live such virtue hath my pen 
where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men

i grant thou wert not married to my muse
and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
finding thy worth a limit past my praise
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the time bettering days
and do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
in true plain words by thy true telling friend
and their gross painting might be better used
where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused

i never saw that you did painting need
and therefore to your fair no painting set
i found or thought i found you did exceed
that barren tender of a poets debt
and therefore have i slept in your report
that you yourself being extant well might show
how far a modern quill doth come too short
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
this silence for my sin you did impute
which shall be most my glory being dumb
for i impair not beauty being mute
when others would give life and bring a tomb
there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
than both your poets can in praise devise

who is it that says most which can say more
than this rich praise that you alone are you
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory
but he that writes of you if he can tell
that you are you so dignifies his story
let him but copy what in you is writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit
making his style admired every where
you to your beauteous blessings add a curse
being fond on praise which makes your praises worse

my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still
while comments of your praise richly compiled
reserve their character with golden quill
and precious phrase by all the muses filed
i think good thoughts whilst others write good words
and like unlettered clerk still cry amen
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polished form of well refined pen
hearing you praised i say tis so tis true
and to the most of praise add something more
but that is in my thought whose love to you
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
then others for the breath of words respect
me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect

was it the proud full sail of his great verse
bound for the prize of all too precious you
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid my verse astonished
he nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
as victors of my silence cannot boast
i was not sick of any fear from thence
but when your countenance filled up his line
then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine

farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou knowst thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting
and for that riches where is my deserving
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
thy self thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgement making
thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
in sleep a king but waking no such matter

when thou shalt be disposed to set me light
and place my merit in the eye of scorn
upon thy side against myself ill fight
and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
with mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults concealed wherein i am attainted
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory
and i by this will be a gainer too
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
the injuries that to myself i do
doing thee vantage double vantage me
such is my love to thee i so belong
that for thy right myself will bear all wrong

say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
and i will comment upon that offence
speak of my lameness and i straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defense
thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
to set a form upon desired change
as ill myself disgrace knowing thy will
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest i too much profane should do it wrong
and haply of our old acquaintance tell
for thee against my self ill vow debate
for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate

then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
and do not drop in for an after loss
ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow
come in the rearward of a conquered woe
give not a windy night a rainy morrow
to linger out a purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
when other petty griefs have done their spite
but in the onset come so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortunes might
and other strains of woe which now seem woe
compared with loss of thee will not seem so

some glory in their birth some in their skill
some in their wealth some in their bodys force
some in their garments though new fangled ill
some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
wherein it finds a joy above the rest
but these particulars are not my measure
all these i better in one general best
thy love is better than high birth to me
richer than wealth prouder than garments costs
of more delight than hawks and horses be
and having thee of all mens pride i boast
wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
all this away and me most wretched make

but do thy worst to steal thyself away
for term of life thou art assured mine
and life no longer than thy love will stay
for it depends upon that love of thine
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs
when in the least of them my life hath end
i see a better state to me belongs
than that which on thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
o what a happy title do i find
happy to have thy love happy to die
but whats so blessed fair that fears no blot
thou mayst be false and yet i know it not

so shall i live supposing thou art true
like a deceived husband so loves face
may still seem love to me though altered new
thy looks with me thy heart in other place
for there can live no hatred in thine eye
therefore in that i cannot know thy change
in manys looks the false hearts history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whatever thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show

they that have power to hurt and will do none
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmoved cold and to temptation slow
they rightly do inherit heavens graces
and husband natures riches from expense
they are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
the summers flower is to the summer sweet
though to itself it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds

how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which like a canker in the fragrant rose
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
that tongue that tells the story of thy days
making lascivious comments on thy sport
cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what a mansion have those vices got
which for their habitation chose out thee
where beautys veil doth cover every blot
and all things turns to fair that eyes can see
take heed dear heart of this large privilege
the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge

some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
both grace and faults are loved of more and less
thou makst faults graces that to thee resort
as on the finger of a throned queen
the basest jewel will be well esteemed
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated and for true things deemed
how many lambs might the stern wolf betray
if like a lamb he could his looks translate
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine is thy good report

how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
what old decembers bareness everywhere
and yet this time removed was summers time
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widowed wombs after their lords decease
yet this abundant issue seemed to me
but hope of orphans and unfathered fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
and thou away the very birds are mute
or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
that leaves look pale dreading the winters near

from you have i been absent in the spring
when proud pied april dressed in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odor and in hue
could make me any summers story tell
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
nor did i wonder at the lilies white
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
they were but sweet but figures of delight
drawn after you you pattern of all those
yet seemed it winter still and you away
as with your shadow i with these did play

the forward violet thus did i chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
if not from my loves breath the purple pride
which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed
the lily i condemned for thy hand
and buds of marjoram had stolen thy hair
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
a third nor red nor white had stolen of both
and to his robbery had annexed thy breath
but for his theft in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death
more flowers i noted yet i none could see
but sweet or color it had stolen from thee

where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might
spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse and straight redeem
in gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
and gives thy pen both skill and argument
rise resty muse my loves sweet face survey
if time have any wrinkle graven there
if any be a satire to decay
and make times spoils despised every where
give my love fame faster than time wastes life
so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife

o truant muse what shall be thy amends
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends
so dost thou too and therein dignified
make answer muse wilt thou not haply say
truth needs no color with his color fixed
beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay
but best is best if never intermixed
because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
excuse not silence so fort lies in thee
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
and to be praised of ages yet to be
then do thy office muse i teach thee how
to make him seem long hence as he shows now

my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming
i love not less though less the show appear
that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
the owners tongue doth publish every where
our love was new and then but in the spring
when i was wont to greet it with my lays
as philomel in summers front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue
because i would not dull you with my song

alack what poverty my muse brings forth
that having such a scope to show her pride
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside
o blame me not if i no more can write
look in your glass and there appears a face
that over goes my blunt invention quite
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
were it not sinful then striving to mend
to mar the subject that before was well
for to no other pass my verses tend
than of your graces and your gifts to tell
and more much more than in my verse can sit
your own glass shows you when you look in it

to me fair friend you never can be old
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers pride
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
in process of the seasons have i seen
three april perfumes in three hot junes burned
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
steal from his figure and no pace perceived
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
for fear of which hear this thou age unbred
ere you were born was beautys summer dead

let not my love be called idolatry
nor my beloved as an idol show
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one of one still such and ever so
kind is my love to day to morrow kind
still constant in a wondrous excellence
therefore my verse to constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
fair kind and true is all my argument
fair kind and true varying to other words
and in this change is my invention spent
three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
fair kind and true have often lived alone
which three till now never kept seat in one

when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rime
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
then in the blazon of sweet beautys best
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
i see their antique pen would have expressed
even such a beauty as you master now
so all their praises are but prophecies
of this our time all you prefiguring
and for they looked but with divining eyes
they had not skill enough your worth to sing
for we which now behold these present days
have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise

not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
can yet the lease of my true love control
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
and the sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
since spite of him ill live in this poor rime
while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
and thou in this shalt find thy monument
when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent

whats in the brain that ink may character
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
whats new to speak what now to register
that may express my love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
i must each day say oer the very same
counting no old thing old thou mine i thine
even as when first i hallowed thy fair name
so that eternal love in loves fresh case
weighs not the dust and injury of age
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
but makes antiquity for aye his page
finding the first conceit of love there bred
where time and outward form would show it dead

o never say that i was false of heart
though absence seemed my flame to qualify
as easy might i from my self depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
that is my home of love if i have ranged
like him that travels i return again
just to the time not with the time exchanged
so that myself bring water for my stain
never believe though in my nature reigned
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be stained
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
for nothing this wide universe i call
save thou my rose in it thou art my all

alas tis true i have gone here and there
and made my self a motley to the view
gord mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
made old offences of affections new
most true it is that i have looked on truth
askance and strangely but by all above
these blenches gave my heart another youth
and worse essays proved thee my best of love
now all is done save what shall have no end
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof to try an older friend
a god in love to whom i am confined
then give me welcome next my heaven the best
even to thy pure and most loving breast

o for my sake do you with fortune chide
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
thence comes it that my name receives a brand
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in like the dyers hand
pity me then and wish i were renewed
whilst like a willing patient i will drink
potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think
nor double penance to correct correction
pity me then dear friend and i assure ye
even that your pity is enough to cure me

your love and pity doth the impression fill
which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow
for what care i who calls me well or ill
so you oer green my bad my good allow
you are my all the world and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
none else to me nor i to none alive
that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others voices that my adders sense
to critic and to flatterer stopped are
mark how with my neglect i do dispense
you are so strongly in my purpose bred
that all the world besides methinks are dead

since i left you mine eye is in my mind
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function and is partly blind
seems seeing but effectually is out
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
of his quick objects hath the mind no part
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
for if it see the rudst or gentlest sight
the most sweet favor or deformedst creature
the mountain or the sea the day or night
the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
incapable of more replete with you
my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue

or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
drink up the monarchs plague this flattery
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true
and that your love taught it this alchemy
to make of monsters and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble
o tis the first tis flattery in my seeing
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up
mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
and to his palate doth prepare the cup
if it be poisoned tis the lesser sin
that mine eye loves it and doth first begin

those lines that i before have writ do lie
even those that said i could not love you dearer
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
but reckoning time whose millioned accidents
creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents
divert strong minds to the course of altering things
alas why fearing of times tyranny
might i not then say now i love you best
when i was certain oer incertainty
crowning the present doubting of the rest
love is a babe then might i not say so
to give full growth to that which still doth grow

let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wandering bark
whose worths unknown although his height be taken
loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickles compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
if this be error and upon me proved
i never writ nor no man ever loved

accuse me thus that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay
forgot upon your dearest love to call
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
and given to time your own dear purchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight
book both my willfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise accumulate
bring me within the level of your frown
but shoot not at me in your wakend hate
since my appeal says i did strive to prove
the constancy and virtue of your love

like as to make our appetite more keen
with eager compounds we our palate urge
as to prevent our maladies unseen
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
even so being full of your neer cloying sweetness
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
to be diseased ere that there was true needing
thus policy in love to anticipate
the ills that were not grew to faults assured
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which rank of goodness would by ill be curd
but thence i learn and find the lesson true
drugs poison him that so fell sick of you

what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
still losing when i saw myself to win
what wretched errors hath my heart committed
whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
in the distraction of this madding fever
o benefit of ill now i find true
that better is by evil still made better
and ruined love when it is built anew
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
so i return rebuked to my content
and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent

that you were once unkind befriends me now
and for that sorrow which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow
unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours youve passed a hell of time
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
o that our night of woe might have remembered
my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
and soon to you as you to me then tendered
the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
but that your trespass now becomes a fee
mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me

tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
when not to be receives reproach of being
and the just pleasure lost which is so deemed
not by our feeling but by others seeing
for why should others false adulterate eyes
give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies
which in their wills count bad what i think good
no i am that i am and they that level
at my abuses reckon up their own
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel
by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
unless this general evil they maintain
all men are bad and in their badness reign

thy gift thy tables are within my brain
full charactered with lasting memory
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date even to eternity
or at the least so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee thy record never can be missed
that poor retention could not so much hold
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score
therefore to give them from me was i bold
to trust those tables that receive thee more
to keep an adjunct to remember thee
were to import forgetfulness in me

no time thou shalt not boast that i do change
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings of a former sight
our dates are brief and therefore we admire
what thou dost foist upon us that is old
and rather make them born to our desire
than think that we before have heard them told
thy registers and thee i both defy
not wondering at the present nor the past
for thy records and what we see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
this i do vow and this shall ever be
i will be true despite thy scythe and thee

if my dear love were but the child of state
it might for fortunes bastard be unfathered
as subject to times love or to times hate
weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered
no it was builded far from accident
it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent
whereto the inviting time our fashion calls
it fears not policy that heretic
which works on leases of short numbered hours
but all alone stands hugely politic
that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
to this i witness call the fools of time
which die for goodness who have lived for crime

weret aught to me i bore the canopy
with my extern the outward honoring
or laid great bases for eternity
which proves more short than waste or ruining
have i not seen dwellers on form and favor
lose all and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
no let me be obsequious in thy heart
and take thou my oblation poor but free
which is not mixed with seconds knows no art
but mutual render only me for thee
hence thou suborned informer a true soul
when most impeached stands least in thy control

o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
dost hold times fickle glass his fickle hour
who hast by waning grown and therein showst
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
she may detain but not still keep her treasure
her audit (though delayed) answered must be
and her quietus is to render thee

in the old age black was not counted fair
or if it were it bore not beautys name
but now is black beautys successive heir
and beauty slandered with a bastard shame
for since each hand hath put on natures power
fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
but is profaned if not lives in disgrace
therefore my mistress eyes are raven black
her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation with a false esteem
yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
that every tongue says beauty should look so

how oft when thou my music music playst
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
at the woods boldness by thee blushing stand
to be so tickled they would change their state
and situation with those dancing chips
oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
making dead wood more blessed than living lips
since saucy jacks so happy are in this
give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss

the expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action and till action lust
is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallowed bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had having and in quest to have extreme
a bliss in proof  and proved a very woe
before a joy proposed behind a dream
all this the world well knows yet none knows well
to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell

my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
coral is far more red than her lips red
if snow be white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
i have seen roses damasked red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go 
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
as any she belied with false compare

thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
yet in good faith some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan
to say they err i dare not be so bold
although i swear it to myself alone
and to be sure that is not false i swear
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face
one on anothers neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgments place
in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
and thence this slander as i think proceeds

thine eyes i love and they as pitying me
knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
have put on black and loving mourners be
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
and truly not the morning sun of heaven
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
and suit thy pity like in every part
then will i swear beauty herself is black
and all they foul that thy complexion lack

beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me
ist not enough to torture me alone
but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be
me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
and my next self thou harder hast engrossed
of him myself and thee i am forsaken
a torment thrice three fold thus to be crossed
prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward
but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard
thou canst not then use rigour in my jail
and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee
perforce am thine and all that is in me

so now i have confessed that he is thine
and i my self am mortgaged to thy will
myself ill forfeit so that other mine
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
but thou wilt not nor he will not be free
for thou art covetous and he is kind
he learned but surety like to write for me
under that bond that him as fast doth bind
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer that puttst forth all to use
and sue a friend came debtor for my sake
so him i lose through my unkind abuse
him have i lost thou hast both him and me
he pays the whole and yet am i not free

whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
and will to boot and will in over plus
more than enough am i that vexed thee still
to thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
shall will in others seem right gracious
and in my will no fair acceptance shine
the sea all water yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store
so thou being rich in will add to thy will
one will of mine to make thy large will more
let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
think all but one and me in that one will

if thy soul check thee that i come so near
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will
and will thy soul knows is admitted there
thus far for love my love suit sweet fulfill
will will fulfill the treasure of thy love
ay fill it full with wills and my will one
in things of great receipt with ease we prove
among a number one is reckoned none
then in the number let me pass untold
though in thy stores account i one must be
for nothing hold me so it please thee hold
that nothing me a something sweet to thee
make but my name thy love and love that still
and then thou lovst me for my name is will

thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes
that they behold and see not what they see
they know what beauty is see where it lies
yet what the best is take the worst to be
if eyes corrupt by over partial looks
be anchored in the bay where all men ride
why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
why should my heart think that a several plot
which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face
in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
and to this false plague are they now transferred

when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutored youth
unlearned in the worlds false subtleties
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best
simply i credit her false speaking tongue
on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
but wherefore says she not she is unjust
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o loves best habit is in seeming trust
and age in love loves not to have years told
therefore i lie with her and she with me
and in our faults by lies we flattered be

o call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
use power with power and slay me not by art
tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
what needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my oerpressd defense can bide
let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
and therefore from my face she turns my foes
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries
yet do not so but since i am near slain
kill me outright with looks and rid my pain

be wise as thou art cruel do not press
my tongue tied patience with too much disdain
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pity wanting pain
if i might teach thee wit better it were
though not to love yet love to tell me so 
as testy sick men when their deaths be near
no news but health from their physicians know 
for if i should despair i should grow mad
and in my madness might speak ill of thee
now this ill wresting world is grown so bad
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
that i may not be so nor thou belied
bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide

in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes
for they in thee a thousand errors note
but tis my heart that loves what they despise
who in despite of view is pleased to dote
nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted
nor tender feeling to base touches prone
nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone
but my five wits nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man
thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
only my plague thus far i count my gain
that she that makes me sin awards me pain

love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
o but with mine compare thou thine own state
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
or if it do not from those lips of thine
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments
and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine
robbed others beds revenues of their rents
be it lawful i love thee as thou lovst those
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity in thy heart that when it grows
thy pity may deserve to pitied be
if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
by self example mayst thou be denied

lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
one of her feathered creatures broke away
sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
to follow that which flies before her face
not prizing her poor infants discontent
so runnst thou after that which flies from thee
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
and play the mothers part kiss me be kind
so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will
if thou turn back and my loud crying still

two loves i have of comfort and despair
which like two spirits do suggest me still
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman colored ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turned fiend
suspect i may yet not directly tell
but being both from me both to each friend
i guess one angel in anothers hell
yet this shall i neer know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out

those lips that loves own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said i hate
to me that languished for her sake
but when she saw my woeful state
straight in her heart did mercy come
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
was used in giving gentle doom
and taught it thus anew to greet
i hate she altered with an end
that followed it as gentle day
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away
i hate from hate away she threw
and saved my life saying not you

poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
my sinful earth these rebel powers array
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short a lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end
then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
and let that pine to aggravate thy store
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
within be fed without be rich no more
so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men
and death once dead theres no more dying then

my love is as a fever longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
the uncertain sickly appetite to please
my reason the physician to my love
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
hath left me and i desperate now approve
desire is death which physic did except
past cure i am now reason is past care
and frantic mad with evermore unrest
my thoughts and my discourse as madmens are
at random from the truth vainly expressed
for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
who art as black as hell as dark as night

o me what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
loves eye is not so true as all mens no
how can it o how can loves eye be true
that is so vexed with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
the sun itself sees not till heaven clears
o cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind
lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find

canst thou o cruel say i love thee not
when i against myself with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of my self all tyrant for thy sake
who hateth thee that i do call my friend
on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon
nay if thou lourst on me do i not spend
revenge upon myself with present moan
what merit do i in my self respect
that is so proud thy service to despise
when all my best doth worship thy defect
commanded by the motion of thine eyes
but love hate on for now i know thy mind
those that can see thou lovst and i am blind

o from what power hast thou this powerful might
with insufficiency my heart to sway
to make me give the lie to my true sight
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantise of skill
that in my mind thy aworst all best exceeds
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
if thy unworthiness raised love in me
more worthy i to be beloved of thee

love is too young to know what conscience is
yet who knows not conscience is born of love
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
for thou betraying me i do betray
my nobler part to my gross bodys treason
my soul doth tell my body that he may
triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud of this pride
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
no want of conscience hold it that i call
her love for whose dear love i rise and fall

in loving thee thou knowst i am forsworn
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn
in vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee
when i break twenty i am perjured most
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and all my honest faith in thee is lost
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
or made them swear against the thing they see
for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i
to swear against the truth so foul a lie

cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
a maid of dians this advantage found
and his love kindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valley fountain of that ground
which borrowed from this holy fire of love
a dateless lively heat still to endure
and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
against strange maladies a sovereign cure
but at my mistress eye loves brand new fired
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast
i sick withal the help of bath desired
and thither hied a sad distempered guest
but found no cure the bath for my help lies
where cupid got new fire my mistress eyes

the little love god lying once asleep
laid by his side his heart inflaming brand
whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
came tripping by but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warmed
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
which from loves fire took heat perpetual
growing a bath and healthful remedy
for men diseased but i my mistress thrall
came there for cure and this by that i prove
loves fire heats water water cools not love
